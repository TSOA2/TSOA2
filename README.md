### About
I have invested most of my time into programming, and occasionally make public some small projects that I have made. I mostly program in C, but I also know x86(_64) assembly, Python, a little bit of JavaScript, and I've done a small amount of Swift. Currently, I'm learning Rust.

### Interests
The fact that I mostly program in C may be indicative that I like understanding how things work from the ground up. I've experimented with OS development, but I haven't put any major commitment into any related projects; I mostly program in user space.
